standard is file ends in `.sh`
- when a command runs the OS first checks if the file is ELF
- if not, OS checks for `#!interpreter-program` and if it is there, runs the interpreter program
- must have execute perms to be able to run

/bin/ksh - Korn shell (more powerful)
/bin/bash - GNU shell (standard linux shell)
/bin/tcsh
