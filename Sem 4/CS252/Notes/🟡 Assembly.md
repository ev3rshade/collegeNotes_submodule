# Assembly

> Assembly is an array of instructions that is executed one by one sequentially, sometimes jumps to diff instruction locations (branch)

C/C++ compilers generates assembly language!!
--> higher level languages will execute on top of programs an libraries compiled in C/C++

## Tips for Writing Assembly Code

Write the code in C first
TRANSFER DATA BACK TO LOCAL VARIABLES

**WRITE COMMENTS!!!** --> the C code
