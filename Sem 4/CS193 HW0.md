# CS 193 Homework 0 - GitHub and Your Own Website!

### What is this assignment

Throughout this homework, you will create a personal GitHub account, use that GitHub account to modify some code from the homework repository, and then submit it to us for grading! This same basic process will be used throughout CS193 to complete and turn in all of your homework. For this first one, we're focusing on getting you used to the process.

### When is this due?

#### **JAN 23 11:59 PM EST**

### When will I know that I'm done

When you have a GitHub account, submitted your GitHub username, and have a website with all the info required. The info is described later in the assignment. We will be using the same link you use to view your website to grade it.
