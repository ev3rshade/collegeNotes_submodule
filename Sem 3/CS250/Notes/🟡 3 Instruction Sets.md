# Instruction Sets
> the set of commands understood by a given (computer) architecture
> i.e. the fundamental language of a computer

==The instruction set used in this course is [[ARM LEGv8]]==


---
### 1 Characteristics

### 1.1 Instruction Format
- Length
- Number and size of fields
- Encoding scheme

### 1.2 Instruction Types
### One type
#### Arithmetic
#### Data Transfer
> a command that moves data between memory and registers

#### Logical
LSL LSR
AND OR NOT EOR
#### Conditional Branch
> test value, then transfer control to a new address in the program based on the outcome of the value tested


Branch address table (branch table) - a table of addresses of alternative instruction sequences
#### Unconditional Jump

### Another type
#### R type
> register type
> uses bits 20:10 for two fields: an operand register (5 bits), and a shift amount (6 bits)
#### I type
> immediate type
#### D type
> data transfer
> uses a constant to indicate the offset from a base address. A D-type instruction has a 9 bit immediate field


## 2 Instruction Representation

### 1.1 Fields of an instruction
#### Opcode
> the field that denotes the operation and format of an instruction

### Encoding of an instruction
==see table 2.10==


### Compiling instructions

## 3  Instruction Execution
######  Stored program concept
> idea that programs are stored on computers alongside data
###### Basic steps
1. fetch from memory using program counter (PC)
2. read one or two registers, using fields of the instruction to select the registers to read.
	1. for the `LDUR` and `CBZ` instructions, we need to read only one register, but most other instructions require reading two registers.
3. ALU - use to execute instruction for one of the following
	1. use ALU for address calculation
	2. use ALU for arithmetic-logic
	3. use ALU for comparisons

###### Branching
1. Branch taken:  A branch where the branch condition is satisfied and the program counter (PC) becomes the branch target. All unconditional branches are taken branches.
2. Branch not taken or (untaken branch): A branch where the branch condition is false and the program counter (PC) becomes the address of the instruction that sequentially follows the branch.

## 4 Real World Instruction sets
- MIPS
- ARMv7 (32-bit) instructions
- x86 instructions
- ARMv8 (64-bit) instruction set

## 5 Portability

If 2 computers share same ISA then assembly language is portable between them. 
- However a counter example is x86, which has two incompatible assembly languages. One was created by Intel/AMD. The other by AT&T. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax)
