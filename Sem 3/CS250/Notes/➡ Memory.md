## 1 Characteristics of a memory system

### 1.1 Volatility

#### Volatile Memory
> memory that loses data when power is removed

Examples: registers, cache, DRAM

#### Non-volatile Memory
> retains data without power

Examples: flash, SSD, HDD, ROM



### 1.2 Access Time / Latency
> How long it takes to retrieve a single piece of data

Fast memory (registers, cache) --> close to CPU

Slow memory (disk) --> furthest away

As we move down the memory hierarchy, access time increases.



### 1.3 Bandwidth
> How much data can be transferred per second (Bytes / Second)

High bandwidth does not necessarily mean low latency.



### 1.4 Capacity
> How much data can be stored (Bytes)

###### Unit - byte

kilo | mega | giga | tera | peta | exa | zetta | yotta
kibi | mebi | gibi | tebi | pebi | exbi | zebi | yobi

Typically, lower levels of the hierarchy have higher capacity.



### 1.5 Organization and Addressability (how data is organized and accessed)

#### Word Size
> (see 2. Representing Data) (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.)

#### Block (or line)
> The minimum unit of information transferred between memory levels.

Caches move data in blocks (cache lines), not individual bytes.

#### Addressable Units
> what unit is being used to address data (e.g. byte addressing)

Most modern systems use byte addressing.




### 1.6 Physical Structure / Technology
> What is the hardware being used

e.g.  
Registers  
SRAM  
DRAM  
Flash  
Magnetic Disk

(see 3. below for more detail)




### 1.7 Access Method

#### Random Access
- RAM, caches, ROM
    
#### Sequential access
(not relevant to this course)

#### Read-only vs. Read Write
- memory that can be only read or memory that is both read and write

#### Block vs. Byte access
- Reading by large, fixed size chunks or byte by byte



### 1.8 Cost per Bit

Higher-performance memory costs more, driving design by MEMORY HIERARCHY

Registers --> extremely expensive  
Cache --> expensive  
DRAM --> cheap  
SSD --> cheaper  
HDD --> cheapest

### 1.9 Power Consumption (not relevant in cs250)
> different memory types have different power needs

## 2 Memory Access

### 2.1 Measures of Memory Access

#### Hit Rate
> The fraction of memory accesses found in a level of the memory hierarchy.

#### Miss Rate
> The fraction of memory accesses not found in a level of the memory hierarchy.

Miss rate = 1 - hit rate

#### Hit Time
> The time required to access a level of the memory hierarchy, including the time needed to determine whether the access is a hit or a miss.

#### Miss penalty
> The time required to fetch a block into a level of the memory hierarchy from the lower level.

Includes time to:
- access the block
- transmit the block from one level to the other
- insert the block into the level that experienced the miss
- pass the block to the requestor

## 3 Memory Hierarchy
> A structure that uses multiple levels of memories; as the distance from the processor increases, the size of the memories and the access time both increase.

### 3.1 Design of Memory Hierarchy

Temporal Locality
> The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced then it will tend to be referenced again soon.

Spatial Locality
> The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced, data locations with nearby addresses will tend to be referenced soon.

The memory hierarchy is built with these two principles in mind.

## 5 Performance

### Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)

AMAT = Hit time + (Miss rate × Miss penalty)

Used to evaluate memory hierarchy performance for in-order processors.

Limitationss
- Less accurate for out-of-order processors
- Assumes the processor stalls on cache misses

## 6 Error Handling

### Error detection code
> A code that enables the detection of an error in data, but not the precise location and, hence, correction of the error.

Examples:
- Parity bits
- Checksums
    

### Error correction code (ECC)
> Codes that detect and correct errors in memory.

Used in:
- Main memory (DRAM)
- Servers and safety-critical systems

Example of dependability via redundancy

## 6 Pitfalls and Fallacies (Memory Hierarchy & Storage)

### 6.1 Pitfalls

#### 6.1.1 Ignoring Memory System Behavior

**Pitfall:** Writing programs or compiler-generated code without considering the memory hierarchy.

- This can be restated as the fallacy: "Programmers can ignore memory hierarchies."
- Cache-aware algorithms can significantly improve performance.
    

#### 6.1.2 Forgetting Byte Addressing and Block Size in Cache Simulation

**Pitfall:** Incorrectly simulating or analyzing caches by ignoring:

- whether addresses are byte, word, or block addresses
- the cache block (line) size
    

Key points:

- Mapping depends on the block address, not the raw byte address
- Always clarify the address unit before calculating cache indices
    

#### 6.1.3 Insufficient Set Associativity in Shared Caches

**Pitfall:** Using a shared cache with fewer ways than the number of cores sharing it.

- Leads to conflict misses
- Causes performance regressions in parallel programs
    

#### 6.1.4 Using AMAT for Out-of-Order Processors

**Pitfall:** Evaluating memory performance using AMAT for out-of-order processors.

- AMAT assumes the processor stalls on misses
- Modern processors can overlap multiple misses
    

#### 6.1.5 Extending Address Spaces with Segmentation

**Pitfall:** Adding segments on top of an existing unsegmented address space.

- Complicates pointers and register usage
- Flat address spaces are simpler and more robust
    

### 6.2 Fallacies

#### 6.2.1 Disk Failure Rates Match Specifications

**Fallacy:** Manufacturer-specified disk failure rates reflect real-world behavior.
- Actual failure rates are often 3–6× higher
    

#### 6.2.2 Operating Systems Are Best at Scheduling Disk Access

**Fallacy:** The OS should schedule disk I/O for optimal performance.
- Disk controllers know the physical layout better than the OS

## 7 Circuitry

### 7.1 Basic Memory Circuits

#### Flip-flop
> a memory element for which output is equal to the value of the stored state inside the element and for which the internal state is changed only on a clock edge.

- D flip-flop: stores the input value on the clock edge

#### Latch
> A memory element in which the output is equal to the value of the stored state inside the element and the state is changed whenever the appropriate inputs change and the clock is asserted.

- S'R' latch: a basic 1-bit memory element built from NOR gates
    

### 7.2 Timing

#### Setup time
> The minimum time that the input to a memory device must be valid before the clock edge

#### Hold Time
> The minimum time during which the input must be valid after the clock edge.

---

## Units / terminology

Fault
> used to mean failure of a component

Synchronous system (7.7)
> A memory system that employs clocks and where data signals are read only when the clock indicates that the signal values are stable.
