# Processor
## Types
### Uniprocessor
> A computer system with one processor. Most common design.
### Multiprocessor
> A computer system with at least two processors. This computer is in contrast to a uniprocessor, which has one, and is increasingly hard to find today.

## Performance
##### Bisection bandwidth
> The bandwidth between two equal parts of a multiprocessor. This measure is for a worst case split of the multiprocessor.


## Terminology

Context switch
> A changing of the internal state of the processor to allow a different process to use the processor that includes saving the state needed to return to the currently executing process.

Message passing
> Communicating between multiple processors by explicitly sending and receiving information.

Receive message routine
> A routine used by a processor in machines with private memories to accept a message from another processor.

Send message routine
> A routine used by a processor in machines with private memories to pass a message to another processor.
