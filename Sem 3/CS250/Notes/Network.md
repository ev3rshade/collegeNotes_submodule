##### Wide Area Network (WAN)
>A network extended over hundreds of kilometers that can span a continent

## Networks and Processors
#### Fully connected network
> A network that connects processor-memory nodes by supplying a dedicated communication link between every node.

## Performance
##### Network bandwidth
> Informally, the peak transfer rate of a network; can refer to the speed of a single link or the collective transfer rate of all links in the network.




## Terminology
