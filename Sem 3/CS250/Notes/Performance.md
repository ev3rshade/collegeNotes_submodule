# Performance
> metrics on a computer that define how efficient of a device it is | speed | resource use| etc. |

## Time Metrics
### Response Time / Execution Time
> total time req for a computer to complete a task (disk access, memory access, I/O activity, OS overhead, CPU execution time, etc.)
- CPU execution time
- User CPU time
- System CPU time
##### Units
- Clock cycle (inverse clock rate)
- CPI Clock cycle per instruction

### Throughput (bandwidth)
> number of tasks completed per unit of time

## Energy Metrics
==see 1.7==
