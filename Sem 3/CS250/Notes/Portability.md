# Portability

If 2 computers share same ISA then assembly language is portable between them. 
- However a counter example is x86, which has two incompatible assembly languages. One was created by Intel/AMD. The other by AT&T. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax)
