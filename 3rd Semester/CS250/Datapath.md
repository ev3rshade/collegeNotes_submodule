# Datapath
> a unit used to operate on or hold data within a processor. In the LEGv8 implementation includes: instruction and data memories, the register file, the ALU, and adders 
> i.e. path of data flow

## Components
Registers [[Memory Hardware]]
- Program counter (PC)
- Register file
ALU [[Circuitry]]
Addressing

## Implementation
Various implementations
##### Units needed to implement R-format ALU operations
1. the register file
2. ALU.
##### The four units needed to implement loads and stores
1. register file
2. ALU
3. data memory unit
4. and sign extension unit
5. (additional) Wires/muxes
##### The five units needed for a branch
1. ALU - evaluates branch condition
2. adder - computes branch target address (sign extending, then shifting left by 2)
3. The remaining datapath portion for fetching instructions and incrementing the program counter. Nearly the full LEGv8 datapath is now shown.
	1. Program counter
	2. adder
	3. mux

#### Single cycle implementation
> (single clock implementation) an implementation which an instruction is executed in one clock cycle. it is too slow to be practical

#### Multicycle Implementation
> 5 stage instruction execution (see [[Pipelining]])

## Terminology
Datapath element
> A unit used to operate on or hold data within a processor. In the LEGv8 implementation, the datapath elements include the instruction and data memories, the register file, the ALU, and adders.
