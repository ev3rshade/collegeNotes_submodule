Register file
> A state element that consists of a set of registers that can be read and written by supplying a register number to be accessed.

### Program Counter
> a special CPU register that holds the memory of the next instruction to be executed

##### Memory Access
- **Base register** + Offset
- Destination register - the register that receives the result of an operation

### Volatile /nonvolatile
#### Volatile
##### SRAM
- integrated circuits that are memory arrays with (usually) a single access port that can provide either a read or a write
- faster and less dense than DRAM
##### DRAM #revise
> Memory built as an ic. random access

#### Non volatile
##### Disk Memory
- **Track** - One of thousands of concentric circles that make up the surface of a magnetic disk
	- **Sector** - One of the segments that make up a track on a magnetic disk; a sector is the smallest amount of information that is read or written on a disk
- Process of accessing data from a disk
	- **Seek** - The process of positioning a read/write head over the proper track on a disk
	- **Rotational latency** - Also called rotational delay. The time required for the desired sector of a disk to rotate under the read/write head; usually assumed to be half the rotation time
	- **Transfer time** - The time required to transfer a block of bits
- A magnetic disk is a MECHANICAL DEVICE!!!
##### Flash Memory
- is a type of _electrically erasable programmable read-only memory_ (EEPROM) (semiconductor) (more expensive per bit)
